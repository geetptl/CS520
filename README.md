## Design

Mark done against whatever is over and put in the commit message for reference
Add or remove any step according to what is needed

- Create sample grids for test cases with 70% probability of unblocked
- Creating adjacency matrix from grid or grid from the randomly generated adjacency matrix for the previous points (related)
- Finding the neighboring nodes of a given node
- Checking if the neighboring nodes are blocked
- Updating adjacency matrix with new blocked node information
- DFS algorithm for g(x)
- Manhattan distance for Heuristic for h(x)
- Finding f(x)
- Moving the next step according to f(x)
- A* closing condition
- Deal with when path doesn't exist
- Visualization of path (save as GIF)
- Breaking ties, adding priority
- Finding the difference in initial heuristic and actual time taken
- Forward vs. Backward A*
- ADAPTIVE A* (will be dealt with after this is done)
- Adaptive vs. Non-Adaptive A*
- Statistical Significance
- Optimizing the algorithms
